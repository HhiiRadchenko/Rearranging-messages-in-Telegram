This is a simple tool to help with transferring large or small amounts of data, from different sources. 
To send them to a single location, or to multiple locations.

The code is based on two key libraries:
1) Telethon -- for interacting with Telegram.
2) Asuncio -- to synchronize data sending.

This ready-made tool can be immediately transferred to a remote server or can be customized as you like
By default, all data (text, stickers, pictures, videos, etc.) are sent. 
All this can be customized and filtered as well.
